# Hi

Is this working?

## Let's talk about graphs

In computer science when we say Graph we mean dots and dashes

## Dots and Arrows

What is a Graph?

- In mathematics, a Graph is a set of vertices and edges.

- In the world of mathematics, Jane Doe is still related to John Doe even if
they broke up - she now has a "hates" relation with John Doe.
